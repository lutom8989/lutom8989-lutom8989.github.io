when you grow up,

当你年轻的时候，

you tend to get told that the world is the way it is ,

所有人都告诉你世界就是这个样子的

and your life is just to live your life inside the world.

所谓人生就是适应这个世界的样子

Try not to bash into the walls too much.

没必要去撞太多次南墙

Try to have a nice family life, have fun , save a little money.

拥有美满的家庭生活， 过得开心点，再存点钱。

But life… that”s a very limited life.

但是那是狭隘的人生。

Life can be much broader.

人生远比那广阔得多。

Once you discover one simple fact

一旦你发现一个简单的事实

and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you,

and you can change it , you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

你也可以改变它，影响它，甚至可以自己去创造它

And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will ,

一旦你明白你可以戳一戳它，

you know if you push in ,something will pop out the other side ,

你从这段推一推，另一端就会有东西弹出来

that you can change it, that you can mode it.

That”s maybe the most important thing.
