John Connor: (message sent to Sara Connor  through Kyle Reese)

"Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.

I can't help you with what you must soon face except to say that the future is not set.

You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist."

from   movie < Terminator 1984 >
