### Shanghai Disneyland Reopens With Strict  Safety Procedures
Limited capacity, face masks and plastic gloves to ride roller coasters: the opening offers a glimpse of how other Disney parks may cope.
The elephants are flying again.

On Monday, one of the Walt Disney Company’s 14 closed theme parks, Shanghai Disneyland, reopened to visitors on a limited basis, offering a first peek into the kind of escape Mickey Mouse can offer in the age of face masks, social distancing and disinfectants.

“It has been an emotional morning,” Joe Schott, president and general manager of the Shanghai Disney Resort, said in a phone interview. “There is light at the end of the tunnel.”

From a business standpoint, Shanghai Disneyland will be operating far below its potential. The Chinese government has limited capacity at the  park to 24,000 people daily, less than one-third of its pre-outbreak capacity. Bob Chapek, Disney’s chief executive, said last week that Disney would reduce ticket sales even further — “far below” the government’s limit, in his words — to make sure that employees can enforce new safety rules, including temperature checks for ticket holders upon arrival. Fewer tickets sold means decreased food and merchandise sales.

### 上海迪士尼重新开园 安全措施严格
限制人数，戴口罩 坐过山车需戴塑胶手套:上海本次的开业方式为其他迪士尼乐园提供了样本
周一，迪士尼公司14家停业的主题公园之一，上海市迪士尼乐园，在有限制的基础上重新向游客开放了。在这个充满口罩，社交距离限制和消毒水的时代，给人们和米老鼠见一面的机会
‘这是一个激动人心的早晨’ 上海迪士尼乐园的总裁和总经理，乔.斯科特在电话采访里说，‘隧道的尽头有光’
从生意的角度来说，上海迪士尼乐园将会在远低于原来容量的水平之上运作。中国政府将每天的进园人数限制在2万4千人，比疫情爆发前的三分之一还要少。迪士尼的行政主管鲍勃.查伯克说，上周迪士尼卖的票比政府的限制
还要更加少。以他的话来说，是为了确保员工能强制执行新的安全法则，其中就包括持票游客的体温测量。卖的票少，就意味着卖的食物也少，卖的商品也少。
