Well,if you're watching this,I'm glad,because it means you are safe, and that's all I wanted.I wish I could be there with you,but you probably know now,I wouldn't have much time anyway.So I made my choice and I don't regret it.Anyway,not too long from now,there gonna be another little Scofield running around.And Lincoln，I want you to promise me,no matter what,they're gonna grow up knowing their uncle is never far away.And Sara，I want you to promise me that you're gonna keep an eye on Lincoln.As you may have noticed that he has a tendency to get in trouble.You know we spend so much of our lives not saying the things we want to say,the things we should say. We speaking in code,we send little messeges,origami.So now,plainly simply,I want to say that I love you both,very much.And I want you to promise me that you're gonna tell my child,that you're gonna tell my child how much they are loved everyday.And remind them how lucky they are，to be free.Because we are,we are free now.Finally,we are free!

如果你们在看的话，我很高兴，因为你们现在安全了，这是我一直想要的。我希望我能一直陪伴你们，但你们可能已经知道，反正我时日已不多了，所以，我做了自己的选择，我无怨无悔。不管怎么说，小Scofield不久就要出生了，Lincoln，我要你保证，无论发生什么，你都要照顾好他们，让他们知道叔叔与他们同在，Sara，我要你保证，管好林肯，他这个人总爱受麻烦眷顾。你知道，生命中，我们花了太多的时间，却没说出几句由衷的肺腑之言，我们的肺腑之言，我们用暗语表达，用纸花传言。此时此刻，千言万语汇成一句话，我想说：我爱你们，非常地爱你们。我要你们保证，告诉我的孩子..告诉我的孩子我们有多爱他，提醒他们，能够自由有多幸运，因为..我们现在..我们现在自由了，终于..我们自由了！！
